Overview
This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict diseases based on a user's selected symptoms. The prediction is made using four different algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Naive Bayes. The user interacts with the application through a simple Tkinter GUI, and the prediction results are stored in an SQLite database.

Features
Multiple ML algorithms: Uses Decision Tree, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, and Naive Bayes to provide diverse predictions.
User-friendly GUI: Built with Tkinter, the interface allows users to select symptoms and view predictions easily.
Final prediction: After viewing results from all algorithms, users can click the "Final Outcome" button to get a consolidated prediction.
Database storage: All user data, including patient names and symptoms, is stored in an SQLite database.
